## Python Classes

### Read

OOP is a totally new concept for all of you (especially those who think they know about it :)). It's VERY important that you read at least all the material that is listed bellow. As usual, make sure you type (and as usual never copy & paste), test and understand all examples shown in the following links (including those in the video). The biggest and most important task of this project is the reading. The project itself will not take you more than 2/3 hours (tests excluded) if you take the time to read and understand everything. 

Read or watch in this order:
* A simple introduction to [Object Oriented Programming](https://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) without going into much detail:
  * Read everything until the paragraph "Inheritance" excluded
  * You do NOT have to learn about class attributes, ```classmethod``` and ```staticmethod``` yet
* [Object-Oriented Programming](http://www.python-course.eu/python3_object_oriented_programming.php). Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows things the way you should not use or write a class, in order to make you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read everything. Read only the following paragraphs:
  * General Introduction
  * First-class Everything
  * A Minimal Class in Python
  * Attributes
  * You NOT have to learn about class attributes
  * Methods
  * The ```__init__``` Method
  * Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and Information Hiding
  * Public- Protected- and Private Attributes
* [Properties vs. Getters and Setters](http://www.python-course.eu/python3_properties.php)
* TL;DR; - A good wrap-up video about everything you need to know for this project: [Learn to Program 9 : Object Oriented Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AGyBuVCTeE&)

Last thing: Documentation are now mandatory! each module, class and method must contains docstring as comments. [Example Google Style Python Docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html)
